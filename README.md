# Day 1 - Build a Simple REST API with Spring Boot

Welcome to Day 1 of my 30 Days, 30 Projects challenge! In this project, Iâ€™ve built a simple REST API using Spring Boot to handle a Task management system with basic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations.

## Technologies Used
- **Java** (JDK 17+ recommended)
- **Spring Boot**
- **Spring Data JPA** (for database integration)
- **PostgreSQL** (or H2 for simplicity)
- **Maven** (or Gradle)
- **Postman** / **cURL** (for API testing)

## Project Setup

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/30-days-30-projects.git
   cd 30-days-30-projects/day-1
